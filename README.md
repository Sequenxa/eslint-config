## üîç Why Sequenxa‚Äôs Config?

This configuration enforces:
- Type-safe, AI-aware TypeScript
- Secure patterns for identity and verification platforms
- React and Next.js standards
- Tailwind support with zero friction
- Opinionated Prettier formatting
- Prohibited risky constructs like `eval`, `Function`, and `dangerousInnerHTML`

It is actively used and maintained by [Sequenxa](https://sequenxa.com), a leader in AI-powered verification and trust infrastructure.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @sequenxa/eslint-config
````

Also ensure the required peer dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev \
  eslint \
  prettier \
  eslint-plugin-react \
  eslint-plugin-security \
  @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin \
  @typescript-eslint/parser \
  eslint-plugin-tailwindcss
```

---

## Usage

Add to your `.eslintrc` config:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@sequenxa/eslint-config"]
}
```

For React projects:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@sequenxa/eslint-config/react"]
}
```

For Tailwind projects:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@sequenxa/eslint-config/tailwind"]
}
```

For all-in-one setups:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@sequenxa/eslint-config/react",
    "@sequenxa/eslint-config/tailwind"
  ]
}
```

Prettier is automatically compatible if you add:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5"
}
```

---

## Testing

You can test this config against sample files using:

```bash
npm run test
```

Example test config is included in `.eslintrc.example.json`.

---

## Security Notes

This config enforces:

* No use of `eval` or `Function` constructors
* Disallows `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless explicitly overridden
* Encourages strict type safety boundaries in AI-powered code

If you are building applications involving consent, compliance, or data integrity ‚Äî these settings align with best practices for high-assurance environments.
